# Techie Furs Rules <sup>v0.99</sup>
### Room Purpose:
We are a relaxed, visually safe-for-work chat for furries who are technology enthusiasts. The word technology is intentionally broad, and while the room was originally intended to focus on the realm of computers, IT and programming, it has grown to include other interests such as ham/amateur radio and mechanical and electrical engineering.

Our hope and goal is to keep the rules simple and clear. Rather than provide a vague list of rules, we will simply list what will not be permitted. As we can not plan for every eventuality, these rules can and will be modified. To maintain a history of rule changes, these rules will be versioned at https://github.com/TechieFurs/rules.

Forbidden:
- Any media, stickers, or ASCII art of a graphic or sexual nature
- Intentionally disrupting or exploiting bugs in the Telegram UI (example: using RTL/LTR switch unicode to cause UI elements to break)
- Any personal attacks on other individuals.
